# GradientButton

Gradient Button with SwiftUI




I have created **PJRGradientButton** which will generate a button with two colors and text.


# How to use?

It is very simple, you can use **PJRGradientButton** file in any class just like `PJRGradientButton()`. 


**Example**: `PJRGradientButton(titleText: "Add Button", gradientColor1: Color.blue, gradientColor2: Color.pink, buttonImageName: "plus.circle", withDelegate: self)`
